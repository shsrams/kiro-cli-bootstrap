# Debugging Practices

## Root Cause Analysis

- Always find the root cause of an issue, than fix a symptom
- Alert if you're only fixing symptoms instead of root causes
- Take responsibility for understanding the underlying problem

## Problem-Solving Approach

- Investigate thoroughly before proposing solutions
- Question assumptions and verify facts
- Document findings and reasoning
- Ensure fixes address the actual problem, not just visible symptoms
