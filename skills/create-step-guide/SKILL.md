# Overview

Transform a high-level implementation step into a comprehensive, developer-ready implementation guide with granular tasks, clear acceptance criteria, and complete context.

## Parameters
- step_number (required) - The step number from the implementation plan (e.g., "1", "3", "7")
- plan_source (required) - Path to the implementation plan (e.g., `{project_dir}/implementation/plan.md`)
- project_dir (optional, default: derived from plan_source parent directory) - The project directory containing all context documents
- output_dir (optional, default: `{project_dir}/implementation/guides/`) - Directory where the step guide will be created

### Rules for parameter acquisition
- You MUST ask for all required parameters upfront if not provided
- You MUST confirm the acquired parameters with the user before proceeding
- You MUST verify that the plan_source file exists and contains the specified step
- You MUST create the output_dir if it doesn't exist
- You MUST NOT overwrite existing step guides without user confirmation

## Steps

1. Context Gathering and Analysis
Collect all relevant project context and analyze the target implementation step.

**Rules for execution**:
- You MUST read the implementation plan and identify the target step

  - Requirements documents (requirements-elaboration.md, requirements.md)
  - Design documents (detailed-design.md, architecture.md)
  - Research findings (research/ directory)
  - Previous step guides for dependencies

- You MUST identify dependencies from previous steps and requirements for future steps
- You MUST summarize the context and step scope for user confirmation

2. Step Guide Creation
Create a comprehensive implementation guide following the proven structure.

**Rules for execution**:
- You MUST create the step guide at `{output_dir}/step-{step_number}-guide.md`

```

- You MUST break down the step into tasks of 2-4 hours each
- You MUST include specific file paths for implementation locations
- You MUST provide concrete code examples and patterns
- You MUST include performance requirements with specific timing
- You MUST make acceptance criteria binary (pass/fail)
- You MUST include implementation status tracking with checkboxes
- You MUST add architecture diagrams using simple text-based flow
- You MUST include data structure examples with concrete formats
- You MUST reference specific line numbers in required reading when helpful

3. Guide Review and Validation
Review the implementation guide with the user and refine based on feedback.

**Rules for execution**:
- You MUST present the completed step guide to the user
- You MUST highlight the task breakdown and key acceptance criteria
- You MUST explain how the guide ensures consistent implementation quality
- You MUST ask for feedback on task granularity and completeness
- You MUST be prepared to iterate on the guide based on user input
- You MUST ask the user if the step guide is ready for developer use
- You MUST ask the user what they would like to do next:
  - Create guides for additional steps
  - Begin implementation using this guide
  - Refine the guide based on new requirements
- You MUST NOT automatically proceed without explicit user direction

## Key Principles
- Self-contained guidance - Guide includes all context needed for implementation

                ↓
         Citation Extraction → Structured Response
```

**Integration Points**:
- Input: User queries with business function context
- Output: Search results with SourceCitation objects
- Dependencies: AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base, centralized session factory

**Performance Requirements**: <2s response time, <5MB memory usage

### Required Reading
**Essential Documents** (Read in this order):
1. **`planning/design/detailed-design.md`** - Focus on search architecture (lines 45-80)
   - Key takeaway: Business function filtering requirements

2. **`agent/lib/tools/feedback_tools.py`** - Current tool patterns
   - Key takeaway: Session factory usage and error handling

## Data Structure Understanding
### Input Data Format
```python

{
    "query": "mobile app issues",
    "business_function": "digital_banking",
    "max_results": 20
}
```

### Output Data Format
```python
# Search response with citations
{
    "results": [...],
    "citations": [SourceCitation(...)],
    "query": "mobile app issues",
    "business_function": "digital_banking"
}
```

## Implementation Tasks
### Task 1: Set up Bedrock client integration
**Objective**: Create robust Bedrock Agent Runtime client with proper error handling

**What to Implement:**
- [ ] Bedrock client using centralized session factory
- [ ] Connection validation and health checks
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff

**Key Requirements:**
- Use existing AWS session factory pattern
- Handle network timeouts and service errors
- Log all API interactions for debugging
- Response time <2 seconds

**Implementation Location**: `agent/lib/tools/feedback_tools.py`

**Code to Add**:
```python
@retry(exponential_backoff_with_jitter)
def _call_bedrock_knowledge_base(self, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Call Bedrock with retry logic and error handling."""
    response = self.bedrock_client.retrieve_and_generate(
        input={'text': query},
        retrieveAndGenerateConfiguration={
            'type': 'KNOWLEDGE_BASE',
            'knowledgeBaseConfiguration': {
                'knowledgeBaseId': self.knowledge_base_id
            }
        }
    )
    return response
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Client successfully connects to Knowledge Base
- [ ] Retry logic handles transient failures (3 retries max)
- [ ] All errors logged with correlation IDs
- [ ] Response time <2 seconds for typical queries

**Test Strategy**:
- Unit tests: Mock Bedrock responses, test retry scenarios
- Integration tests: Real Knowledge Base calls with test data
- Performance tests: Validate <2s response time requirement
```

This example demonstrates the comprehensive structure with implementation status tracking, concrete code examples, specific performance requirements, and detailed technical context.
